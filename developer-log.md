# Developer log

This log describes changes across the Greenhouse API project during the development phase of the project.

## [0.0.7] - 21 September 2025

Version 0.0.7 introduces validation rules and refinements to the authentication flow.

New middleware files (`login-rules.js`, `verify-email-rules.js`, and `verify-redirect-rules.js`) were added to enforce input validation for their respective endpoints, strengthening request handling and consistency.

A new `login.hbs` view was created to provide markup and styling for the login page. Several existing modules were updated to support authentication: `user-service.js` now updates users following successful login, `auth-service.js` incorporates business logic for authentication, and `login.js` was extended with endpoint logic.

Supporting changes include adjustments to `register.js` to remove unintended text, updates to `static-routes.js` to route requests to the login view, and enhancements to `style.css` to style the new login interface. Together, these changes establish a more complete and secure authentication workflow with validated endpoints and a dedicated login view.

## [0.0.6] - 21 September 2025

In this commit, the Greenhouse API gained a complete registration and verification flow.

New modules were introduced including `login.js` for basic user authentication, `auth-routes.js` to centralize routing for authentication and email verification, and dedicated models for User and Verification Token resources.

The verification process was expanded with `verify-email.js` to handle email confirmation and `verify-redirect.js` to seamlessly convert GET requests from email links into POST requests through an auto‑submitting form.

Supporting updates were made across the codebase: `deliver-email.js` now propagates verification links correctly, `auth-service.js` and `user-service.js` were extended with business logic for registration and verification, and `error-handler.js` was refined to improve JWT error handling.

The frontend views and styles were also enhanced, with updates to `register.hbs`, `main.hbs`, and `style.css` to support the new create-user and verify-notice flows.

Additionally, `index.js` was updated to serve static assets, and the `serve-favicon` dependency was added to improve client‑side presentation.

Together, these changes establish a robust foundation for user onboarding, authentication, and email verification within the application.

- **Commit message**: `Registration | Email verification | Supporting models`

### Added

Added the following files as part of this commit:

- Created a new `login.js` to perform basic authentication for Users.

- Created a new `User.js` to define the properties and methods representing a User resource.
- Created a new `verify-email.js` to verify user email addresses.
- Created a new `verify-redirect.js` to convert GET requests from activated email verification links to POST requests by passing data through an auto-submitting form.

#### Dependencies

The following runtime dependencies were installed:

- [serve-favicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon).

### Changed

## [0.0.2] - 18 September 2025

This commit was dedicated to the partial modularization of the entry point. New files were created to modularize OS termination signal listeners (`signal-listeners.js`) and attempt graceful shutdowns. (`graceful-shutdown.js`).

Introduced custom error classes for production-grade error handling, including `Api-Error.js`, `Auth-Error.js`, `Bad-Request-Error.js`, `Config-Error.js`, `Database-Error.js`, `Invalid-Parameter-Error.js`, and `Not-Found-Error.js`. Created custom error-handling middleware to generate error messages in the console, logs, and API response, based on the current environment.

- Created a new `error-handler.js` to act as the error boundary and primary error handler for the application.
- Created a new `.markdownlint.json` to enforce custom linting rules for markdown files.
- Created a new `signal-listeners.js` to listen for OS termination signals and trigger graceful shutdowns.
- Created a new `graceful-shutdown.js` to attempt to flush logs, close connections, and ensure a server timeout is set.

### Changed

The following files were updated as part of this commit:

- Updated `logger.js` to accommodate new error handling methods.
- Updated `index.js` to remove existing signal listening and shutdown logic from the entry point into separate files.
